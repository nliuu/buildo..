            </p>
            <p style="color:gold">1. Push your knees out. Imagine a line through the middle of your foot, from your heel to your toes, and track your knee over that line as you bend and and straighten it. This helps engage your glutes and gives you optimum leverage. <br />2. Keep your back flat. Be careful not to round it as you hinge at your hips, to protect your spine. <br />3. Take a big breath. Think about filling your lower stomach and back with air right before you lift the bar. Then brace your core as though someone is going to punch you, and keep it braced that way as you lift. This helps keep your spine neutral.<br />4. Flex your lats. Do this to prepare for the lift, and keep your lats flexed as you lift the bar. This helps you keep the bar close to your body, reducing torque on your back.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
