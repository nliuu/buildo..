            <p style="color:gold">Basically, instead of placing your elbows squarely under your shoulders while planking, extend them so they're roughly at eye level. Also, move them slightly closer together than usual. That's the “long-lever” part of the exercise. The “posterior tilt” part means, essentially, squeezing your butt muscles—hard.</p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
